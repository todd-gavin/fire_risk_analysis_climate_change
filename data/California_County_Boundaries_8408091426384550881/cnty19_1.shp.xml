Madera and Fresno Counties (boundary correction)

Background
A proposed Madera sub basin boundary modification included aligning the Madera southern sub basin boundary with the Madera County boundary, which resulted in an adjust of the North Kings Groundwater Sustainability Agency (NKGSA) boundary. After review NKGSA revealed that a Madera parcel APN 049-102-004 was located within the Fresno County boundary and not Madera County. Based on documents in the Madera County Assessor's Office the parcel is recognized as Madera County's jurisdiction.


Sources Referenced
Assessor's Map No. 49-10

Result
Madera and Fresno county boundaries were adjusted along the southern boundary to include Madera parcel APN 049-102-004.  CAL FIRE adjusted the county boundary using a map (Assessor's Map No.49-10) and Madera County parcel data as guidelines.

Fields were adjusted to fit with new FRAP standards. The four name fields were condensed into one COUNTY name field which utilizes a coded domain set. Instead of the old y/n ISLAND field, there is now a TYPE field which indicated mainland, island, ocean, etc, as well as an ISLAND field that specifies the island group for islands. Both TYPE and ISLAND utilize a code set domain.

The linework has been updated to reflect legal boundary changes between the following counties: Fresno-Merced, Kern-Los Angles, Orange-Riverside, and Orange-Los Angeles.  The linework has been improved for greater accuracy in sections shared by the following counties: Ventura-Kern, Ventura-Santa Barbara, and Lake-Mendocino-Sonoma.

Bureau of Reclamation County Line Modifications (Update)

6 May 2009

Since the time of the last update of the county data by the Department of Conservation's Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (DOC-FMMP) in July 1997, the California Mapping Coordinating Committee (CMCC) has requested that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) resume stewardship of the statewide county boundary data (originally digitized by the US Bureau of Reclamation).  For the past few years CAL FIRE has received suggestions for enhancements to the county data from multiple sources.  Our latest update to county lines is based on comments and input from DOC-FMMP, CA Department of Fish and Game, CA Board of Equalization, Kern County, Orange County, and Ventura County.  Data editing was performed by both Department of Fish and Game and CAL FIRE.  All changes are described below.

When a request was made to change a county line, CAL FIRE looked at two spatial sources: parcel data from counties, and the set of scanned USGS 7.5' topo quads (aka 24k DRGs) on the California Spatial Information Library (CaSIL).  In addition, CAL FIRE also reviewed the legal text for county boundary descriptions (Government Code Section 23100-23158) on the California Legislative Information website:
http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=gov&amp;codebody=23101

Documentation for legal boundary changes was also provided to CAL FIRE by CA Board of Equalization.


Ventura-Kern and Ventura-Santa Barbara Counties

Background

The two county line sections in question are the western edge of Ventura County (shared with Santa Barbara County) and one of the northern edges of Ventura County (shared with Kern County).  Ventura County Fire Protection District contacted CAL FIRE to let us know that the Bureau's line did not line up well with their county parcel data.  Parcel data from Ventura County, Santa Barbara County, and Kern County aligned well with each other, but did not align well with the Bureau's county lines.  Because Ventura County FPD needs CAL FIRE data to align with their data, Ventura County FPD requested that we adjust the Bureau's line.

Result

After considering the sources reviewed, CAL FIRE decided to adjust the two county line sections that Ventura County FPD requested for us to adjust.  The need for county boundary lines that agree with the county linework used by local governments is becoming more critical as more and more local governments are using GIS data from the state.  Parcel data from the three counties does not align perfectly (node-to-node) from county to county.  However, all 3 counties' parcel data illustrate the northwest corner of Ventura County as being about 0.1 mile west of where it is shown on the Bureau file.  In addition, Kern parcel data and Santa Barbara parcel data illustrate one of the northern edges of Kern County as being 0.5 mile north of where it is shown in the Bureau file.

CAL FIRE edited the Bureau's line by "snapping" the Bureau's northwest corner of Ventura County to the northwest corner of Ventura County's parcel data.  CAL FIRE also used Ventura County's parcel data as a basis for snapping the northern section of the Bureau's line by snapping the nodes of the Bureau's line to the nodes of the parcel data.


Lake-Mendocino-Sonoma Counties

Background

The boundary in question is the southeast corner of Mendocino County shared with Lake County and Sonoma County.  Department of Fish and Game observed that the Bureau line did not line up with the scanned USGS 7.5' quad on CaSIL.

Sources Referenced

USGS 7.5' paper quad, "The Geysers" 1975
USGS 7.5' scanned quad, "The Geysers" 1993
Lake County parcel data
Mendocino County parcel data
Sonoma County parcel data

Result

After examining the 1975 USGS 7.5' quad and the 1993 USGS 7.5' quad CAL FIRE determined that USGS changed the way the boundary was drawn in the 1993 quad, which was released after the Bureau digitized the county lines into GIS format back in 1992.  This is not considered a legal change because the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) lines (which form the basis for the county boundary lines in this area) are represented as dashed lines in both quads, which means neither version is up to National Map standards.  However, after comparing parcel data from Lake, Mendocino, and Sonoma counties to the two USGS quads, it is clear that these counties based their county lines on the more recent 1993 quad.  CAL FIRE adjusted the Bureau line for the southeast corner of Lake-Mendocino-Sonoma in order to match both the parcel data and the latest USGS quad.


Fresno-Merced Counties (legal boundary change - January 1, 2008)

Background

On December 31, 2007 a Merced County press release announced that a portion of the Merced-Fresno county line would change on January 1, 2008 by officially moving a portion (6.52 sq mi or 4,175 ac) of Fresno County into Merced County.  The purpose of the change was to enhance access to emergency services for local residents in the area south of Dos Palos.

The vicinity map included in the LAFCo report showed which Fresno parcels would be moved into Merced County.  CAL FIRE adjusted the Bureau line to the new county line by using the vicinity map and Fresno County parcel data as guidelines.


San Bernardino-Riverside Counties (legal boundary change - 2003)

Background

California Board of Equalization reported a minor legal boundary change along the southern boundary of San Bernardino County (near the southwest corner of San Bernardino County) shared with Riverside County.  The section of the boundary that changed is within unincorporated area that is west of the city of Rialto.  Two former Riverside parcels were moved into San Bernardino and two former San Bernardino parcels were moved into Riverside.

Result

California Board of Equalization provided CAL FIRE with copies of documents confirming the boundary change.  Parcel data from San Bernardino and Riverside Counties also confirmed the change.  CAL FIRE adjusted the Bureau line to match with the parcel data.


Yuba-Placer-Sutter Counties (legal boundary change - 2002)

Background

California Board of Equalization reported an annexation by city of Wheatland near the boundary of Yuba County.  This annexation indicated that a legal boundary change had occurred that affected Yuba, Placer, and Sutter Counties-parts of Placer and Sutter had been annexed by Yuba.  Board of Equalization later provided CAL FIRE with the documentation that confirmed the county boundary changes.

Result

The documents provided by Board of Equalization confirmed the boundary change among the three counties.  In addition, the parcel data from the three counties also confirmed the change.  CAL FIRE adjusted the Bureau line to match the parcel data, using Yuba county parcels as the main guideline. 



Kern-Los Angeles Counties (legal boundary change - 2001)

Background

Kern County Fire Department (KCFD) reported a boundary change in northwest Los Angeles County that had not been reflected in the Bureau county line.  The part of the boundary in question was a segment shared between Kern County and Los Angles County.

After examining multiple sources CAL FIRE confirmed that KCFD was correct.  The Los Angeles County parcel data and Kern County parcel data both reflect the boundary change.  In addition the legal text for county boundary descriptions from the California Legislative Information website also confirms the change.  CAL FIRE adjusted the Bureau line so that it would conform to the boundary shown in Kern County's parcel data. 


Orange-Riverside Counties (legal boundary change)

Background

During their review of the Bureau's county lines in 2006, Department of Fish and Game observed an inconsistency along the Orange-Riverside boundary when comparing the Bureau's line with the county line in co100a from the former Teale Data Center Solutions Group.  The area in question is in southwest Riverside County.

Result

Department of Fish and Game (DFG) confirmed that a boundary change had occurred by checking the county boundary legal text on the California Legislative Information website.  DFG adjusted the Bureau line to match co100a, which was already consistent with the legal text description.  CAL FIRE also checked the legal text and concurred that the change was accurate.  CAL FIRE also compared the DFG line adjustment with parcel data from Orange County and Riverside County and determined the alignment with parcel data was good.  So CAL FIRE made no further adjustments to DFG's adjustment in this area.


Orange-Los Angeles Counties (legal boundary change - August 29, 1999)

Background

The Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) contacted CaSIL in 2008 to report that the Bureau's line did not reflect a change along the Orange-Los Angeles County boundary that occurred on August 29, 1999.  The area in question is along the northern boundary of Orange County and shared with the southern boundary of Los Angeles County.

Sources Referenced

Result

Documentation provided by the Orange county LAFCo provided clear evidence of the boundary change in 1999.  CAL FIRE found the area in question by comparing the Bureau's county line to parcel data for Orange County and Los Angeles County.  The Orange County parcel data clearly showed the parcels that Orange County had annexed from Los Angeles County.  CAL FIRE adjusted the Bureau line to match the county line as shown by Orange County parcel data.


Orange County (man-made island)

San Francisco County (along mouth of bay)

Background

Department of Fish and Game observed that the Bureau's western boundary for San Francisco County followed the shoreline and did not include the mouth of the bay between Pt. Reyes (at the southern tip of Marin County) and Pt. Lobos along the northwest shore of San Francisco County.

Department of Fish and Game confirmed that the bay opening is part of San Francisco County by checking the county boundary legal text on the California Legislative Information website.  DFG adjusted the western boundary to include the bay opening.  CAL FIRE and DOC-FMMP have both concurred with this change and CAL FIRE has not made any further adjustments to DFG's adjustment.


Santa Barbara County (offshore islands)

Background

During their review of the Bureau's county lines in 2006, Department of Fish and Game observed that the Bureau's county lines for Santa Barbara did not include Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands.

coastn27 coverage from State Lands Commission

Result

Department of Fish and Game added the missing islands using previously-digitized coastline data (coast27 of State Lands Commission origin).  Both CAL FIRE and DOC-FMMP concur with this change and have not made any further changes to the DFG linework.


Changes other than linework

During their 2006 update of the data, Department of Fish and Game created a multipart version of the counties feature class (using region topology in coverage format), which has 58 multipart features (one record for each county in the attribute table).  CAL FIRE updated linework in both the single part feature class and the multipart feature class.  Both of these feature classes can be found in the File geodatabase.

Department of Fish and Game also added three additional attributes (ABBREV, ABCODE, and FIPS) to both versions of the feature class.  CAL FIRE has kept these attributes, but renamed the FIPS field to ANSI (American National Standards Institute) to reflect the Federal Government's new name for FIPS.  In addition to keeping the attributes from Department of Fish and Game, CAL FIRE has added an ISLAND attribute, which indicates with a Y or N if a feature is an island (making it easy to remove them from display).  CAL FIRE has also updated the ABBREV field to reflect the new county abbreviations recommended by CMCC in April 2009.

In the line feature class, CAL FIRE has also added a TYPE attribute, which classifies the lines into 5 categories: coast, county, island, stateline, and Mexico.  The line feature class includes a cartographic representation, which symbolizes the county lines based on the TYPE categories.

In late 2006, the Department of Fish and Game (DFG) reviewed the 24K dataset known as cnty24k97_1.  Comparisons were made to a high-quality 100K dataset (co100a/county100k from the former Teale Data Center GIS Solutions Group) and legal boundary descriptions from ( http://www.leginfo.ca.gov ).  The cnty24k97_1 dataset was missing Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands.  DFG added the missing islands using previously-digitized coastline data (coastn27 of State Lands Commission origin), corrected a few county boundaries, built region topology, added additional attributes, and renamed the dataset to county24k.

The specific county boundary corrections were as follows:
- San Francisco county boundary corrected to extend across the mouth of San Francisco bay instead of along the coastline as per ( http://www.leginfo.ca.gov ).
- Small changes along the Orange/Riverside county boundary as per the Teale co100a/county100k dataset and ( http://www.leginfo.ca.gov ).

Bureau of Reclamation County Line Modifications  14 July 1997

During the transition to a county line standard for the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP) survey counties, it was discovered that the Bureau of Reclamation's county line file that FMMP wanted to adopt was outdated in two locations. A third area believed to be outdated, but could not be confirmed, was also
changed in the Bureau's master file. All three changes are described below.

When a county line has changed and no longer agrees with the Bureau's master file, the preferred order for incorporating the new linework into it are as follows:

Copying information from digital USGS 7.5' SDTS formatted files.
Copying information from digital USGS 100K DLG formatted files.
Digitizing off of USGS 7.5' paper quads (if they reflect the new county line).
Any other means where a correct boundary can be incorporated.

The modified Bureau of Reclamation file contains the following linework changes:

Butte-Glenn Counties

Background

The area in question is the entire Butte-Glenn county line along the Sacramento River.  There were subtle and not so subtle differences between the FMMP's existing county line and what the Bureau was calling the county line.  Several sources were referenced with no clear indication of where the line fell.  In all the maps reviewed there was never a point in the process where the FMMP had to consider multiple interpretations of the county line. It was either FMMP's existing line or the Bureau's.

Result

After careful consideration of the sources contacted and/or reviewed, it was determined that the FMMP would adopt the 100K USGS DLG line as the county line between Butte and Glenn County.  The biggest obstacles in making this decision were the ignorance of both counties on where their county line fell, and the USGS contradicting itself as to where the line went.  The 100K USGS mylar and 100K DLG matched what FMMP was already using, while the 7.5' USGS paper quad and 7.5' USGS DLG identified a different county line.  In the end it was decided that FMMP would adopt the 100K DLG since it closely resembled the line the FMMP has used all along for these two counties. The adoption of the 100K DLG line was performed by R. Withers in June 1997. The entire common boundary between Butte and Glenn counties was replaced and is distinguished from the rest of the Bureau's linework by color. The change starts at lat. 39- 23' 02.5349" N long. -121- 53' 20.1887" W
and ends at lat. 39- 47' 52.0638" N long. -122- 02' 43.6258" W.

Orange-Riverside Counties

Background

The USGS, Bureau of Reclamation, and the FMMP all had interpreted the county line between Orange and Riverside counties in the same way, but a note from Karen Freeman at the City of Anaheim Planning Department described a minor change that she was aware of between the two.  Upon investigation, it was confirmed that a change had occurred. Since the adjustment of the line was written using bearing and distance, R. Withers tried to draw out the line using the precision placement options of Microstation 95 (version 5 mode). The legal text was obtained from the State of California (the county line change is highlighted in bold and is underlined):

Result

The precision placement of the modified Orange-Riverside line was successful. However, the Bureau's line does not take into account minor directional changes north and south of the main area of concern. As a result, the line had to be redigitized from the USGS 7.5' quadrangle Black Star Canyon.  The new county line is distinguished from the rest of the Bureau's linework by color. The change starts at lat. 33- 46' 00.4197" N long. -117- 34' 37.4973" W and ends at lat. 33- 52' 39.0641" N long. -117- 40' 42.3113" W.

Santa Cruz-Santa Clara Counties

Background

There had been a long history dating back to the late 1980's(?) regarding the correct placement of the county line between Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties. The 100K USGS map did not agree with the 7.5' USGS quadrangles and the counties were of little help in resolving placement of the line. At that time the FMMP decided to go with the 100K line.

In 1997 the issue came up again because the FMMP line did not match the Bureau's county line.  Most of the 7.5' USGS paper quads along the county border were updated by USGS in the early to mid 1990's, and the legal text description of the county line agreed with what was represented on the newer 7.5' quads.

Result

The 100K DLG information was incomplete, but matched the 100K USGS paper map where DLG information was available. The 7.5' DLG information though complete, had some quads that matched the newer 7.5' paper maps and some that appeared to match older 7.5' USGS quads. The problem was finally resolved by digitizing the entire Santa Cruz-Santa Clara line off the newer 7.5' paper quads. This process was completed in May 1997 by R. Withers.  The change begins in the south where San Benito, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties meet, and ends just past the junction of Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and San Mateo counties.  The new county line is distinguished from the rest of the Bureau's linework by color. The change starts at lat. 36- 53' 57.9613" N long. -121- 34' 49.6766" W and ends at lat. 37- 17' 36.4162" N log. -122- 09' 35.4072" W.

Modifications to FMMP County Line's Within Its Files

There are two areas where the Bureau's line and the state's legal text description agreed, and the FMMP county line was out of date.

A county line adjustment between Kern and Ventura counties resulted in about 9-10 sq. mi. going from Ventura to Kern County.  The area was not surveyed on the Ventura side, but falls in the Interim Farmland area of Kern County.  The addition was photo interpreted and incorporated into the 1994 Kern County survey area.  Ventura County was unaffected since the FMMP does not map that portion of the county.

The Tehama-Shasta county line change is located on the Lassen Peak and Gray's Peak USGS quads and involves about 5 sq. mi. going from Tehama to Shasta County.  The FMMP loses land from its overall survey area because there's no soil survey information for that portion of Shasta County. All of the land lost is National Forest Service land and was classified as 'X' when it was mapped as part of Tehama County.
